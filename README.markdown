This is the source code for the **HumHum Ignore User** Safari 5 extension.
When installing it for use with the Safari Extension Builder, please be aware that the source files must be placed into a directory with a name ending in .safariextension, e.g.:
 
* meerkat.safariextension  **<--- Directory** 
1. — global.html
2. — global.js
3. — expunge.js
4. — Settings.plist
5. — Info.plist

*Please note that you will require a Safari developer cert in order to build and install from source using the Safari Extension Builder*
