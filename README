This is the source code for the HumHum Ignore User Safari 5 extension
All Safari 5 extensions must have a top-level directory name ending in .safariextension, e.g. meerkat.safariextension

* Please note that you will require a Safari developer cert in order to build and install from source *

If you have not done so, you must first sign up to the developer program (free) here:
http://developer.apple.com/programs/start/safari/create.php
Then request a Safari extension certificate (free), here:
https://developer.apple.com/safari/certificates/index.action
